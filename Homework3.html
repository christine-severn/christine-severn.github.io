                <p>I hope this message finds you well. My name is Christine Severn and I am currently studying at the Univerity of Denver. In our coursework, we're learning the importance of digital accessibility and methods on how to ensure that web content is accessible for people that use assistive technologies on their computer or mobile device. </p>
                <p>The purpose of this report is to help identify possible website digital accessibility issues in order to prevent any access issues to this website via assistive technologies. The following accessibility checklist is based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/priliminary/">WC3 WAI Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessiblity</a> We hope you find our report helpful and thank you very much for taking the time to consider our recommendations.</p>

                <h3>Website Page Titles</h3>
                <p>In the web page markup, the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag. Good page titles are particularly important for orientation, they help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser tab. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title.</p>
